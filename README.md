## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cryptography-algorithms-python.git
   cd cryptography-algorithms-python
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application
Run the main script to launch the GUI:
```bash
python main.py
```
